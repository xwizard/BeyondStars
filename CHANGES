Version 0.0.4

I do believe that this version will compile on BeOS; all credit to Eugenia at BeNews. Photon torpedoes are now available and rather good; 'z' will ripple them off. I've redone some of the graphics; the ships were looking rather shabby previously. Also the resolution has gone back down to 600x400 for speed considerations. Code has been tidied up a little, subdividing mammoth functions down to smaller sub-functions. Also using my own optimised square root function. AI vastly improved with respect to movement. Please note that the runabouts that hide outside of your phaser arcs and blatter you from above are a _feature_ and not a bug!


Version 0.0.3

A bit of combat, finally! 'Space' will fire your weapons off. Enemy AI and weapons targetting is now pretty mean. Prepare to get walloped pretty good. I've made some rather good looking detonations as well. A sensor display, and also some indicator bars. Red for shields, Green for power levels. 't' should flip the target, though I think that's a little buggy. Plus, the display has been expanded to 800x600. If you get a long stream of "-"s on the console, this means you have frame rate underrun.


Version 0.0.2

A lot of tidier code, and user transparent improvements. This includes functions that save out and load objects from files, rather than the tedious variable defines I had to do before. Much improved auto-pilot. Rather nasty memory overrun that I noticed when loading more than one sprite; look in the 0.0.1 'ship' definition and see that I expanded the rotations from 18 to 36 but left something behind...... 
Some rudimentary weapons fire that doesn't do much. Looks pretty though.


Version 0.0.1

Just establishes a basic 'ship' object only environment, demonstrating graphics, user control and a slightly shabby autopilot. Not really playable in any fashion. You can use the cursors.
