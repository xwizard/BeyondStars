Star Voyager FAQ

Q - So author, who are you?
A - Richard Thrippleton, a 19 year old student. Currently in the 2nd year of a Computer Science degree at Cambridge University(UK).

Q - Will you accept patches from me?
A - No, but I will link to them off your site if they're any good. The reason behind this is that I can't be responsible for code integrity if I take patches that I haven't written. Additionally, I feel it would be unfair to subject third party coders to my whims of licensing.

Q - I've found a bug, what do I do?
A - Well, I'm certainly expecting bugs. If it's a compile error, be very thorough in seeing if it's your mistake first, before contacting me. Then e-mail me with the bug report, plenty of detail please, especially what CPU and OS, quoting the error message verbatim. A debug trace to the exact point of crash would be even more welcome!

Q - Surely there are already games like this for Linux, hence your efforts are redundant?
A - There's XShipWars, which isn't really suited to single player adventures like Star Voyager. FreeTrek is dead. And yes XPilot is very cool, but it's an entirely different game!

Q - Why no updates for ages?
A - Likely because it's term time and I'm busy!

Q - How to get a bigger window?
A - Run sv with the '-x' switch from the command line

Q - Do you consider the game to be nearly finished
A - No

Q - When are you going to create a './configure' script for the source?
A - When I start writing non-portable code.

Q - Have these questions really been Frequently Asked?
A - Not all of them, no. It's a pre-emptive FAQ :)
