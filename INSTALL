Star Voyager installation from source code

Currently these instructions only apply to Unix like systems;
Obtain and install the SDL and SDL_net packages (both base _and_ development)  from your distribution. If you would prefer to compile the SDL library from source, obtain it from http://www.libsdl.org, and make sure to install everything, the libraries, the include files and the sdl-config script.
Once you have SDL installed, go into a shell and cd into the directory you downloaded sv-(version).tar.gz into;

tar xzf sv-(version).tar.gz
cd sv
make
su
(type in your root password when prompted)
make install
exit
sv

And you're in!
Any problems, please contact me, address is in the README file.
