	Star Voyager is a Frontier/Elite class game in a more arcade style 2D environment, themed to the 'Star Trek' universe. It utilises the SDL library for portability, hence it should definitely run on all Linux platforms, and hopefully all *nixes supported by SDL. Windows and MacOS support is theoretically possible.
	Please feel free to e-mail me regarding this game for help, praise or constructive criticism. I would also be quite grateful for anyone who could maintain game binaries in RPM and Debian package format, for any architecture. A Windows binary maintainer would also be very welcome.
	Game controls are documented in the MANUAL file.
