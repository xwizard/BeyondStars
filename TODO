Long term
-
Missions (and make sure they're saved and loaded). Objects bound to ships and stuff that get polled (iscomplete) every so often
Debris streamers from damaged ships - very cool. Where to put it?
Change of 'go to warp' strategy?
Sort out gettarget in reverse
Hashing for player retrieval
Configurable keys
MOTD scheme for server
Prettify the graphics
New ships; Sovereign class?
Spectator mode
Free /all/ dynamic memory on exit for correctness' sake
Graphics blitting efficiency would be good
Improved visibility rules
